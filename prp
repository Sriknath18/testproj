KT Session - Engineering Safety PRP Tool

0:02
For someone, can we start, has it started recording?

0:15
Yeah, depends.

0:17
OK.

0:19
So yeah.

0:19
So let me give you the overview.

0:21
So the app is generally used for identifying, assessing potential hazards and rest to ensure the safety of the assets and environment throughout the project life cycle.

0:30
What does that mean?

0:31
Is it generally follow capital project life cycle process that refers to the stages the project goes through from the initial concept and planning to the completion.

0:40
So whenever we get a project, there are certain steps we follow, right?

0:45
All those steps gets captured in this application.

0:47
So this is not any domain specific.

0:50
This is open to all the projects.

0:52
We can use any project to capture the process that's process and risk that is that can be associated to that project and we can you know maintain in this particular application.

1:04
So one thing that stands out in this project is it requires stakeholders approval to sign off each stage of process.

1:11
So total total there are 4 stages, 6 stages.

1:20
One is among that one is something known as pre installation stage which is an additional stage.

1:26
So as I said earlier, this follows the project life cycle process wherein you know it has to go through different stages before coming to an completion the 1st time.

1:46
And based on that, I can give you the explanation.

1:57
Am I audible?

2:00
Sorry, the pen I you were cut like your voice is breaking last.

2:04
I we didn't get it.

2:06
Why the you are able to get it?

2:09
Arish No, the voice are cutting.

2:11
Your voice is breaking.

2:13
No, just a second.

2:45
Is it audible now?

2:53
So how do you want me to proceed?

2:54
OK, Karthik is in support team these days.

3:02
Yeah.

3:03
So how do you want me to proceed?

3:06
The complete overview of the 101811, yeah, how yeah, deepen.

3:13
So how you can proceed is yeah, basically give an overview of the whole application so that next time.

3:20
So Harish and Aman is someone who will take up the application from the support perspective.

3:26
So yeah, if you can give a KT as well as overview as well as the ticket which you have resolved, you can just let them know you know, what was the issue and if next time it comes up what we can take it up that way.

3:43
So the app is generally used for identifying and accessing the potential hazards and risks to ensure the safety of a certain environment throughout the project life cycle.

3:50
So what does that mean?

3:52
Is it generally follow capital project life cycle process that refers to the stages the project goes through from the initial concept and planning to completion.

4:01
They've been, sorry to interrupt, but I'm not able to hear you properly.

4:05
There is a no voice disturbance.

4:11
Is this just with me?

4:33
Is it better now?

4:36
Yeah, much better.

4:39
Yeah.

4:40
So it generally follow the capital project life cycle process that refers to the pages the project goes through from the initial concept and planning to completion.

4:49
So this is not specific to a single domain, you can use it for all the domains.

4:55
The one thing that stands out about this project is it requires stakeholders approval to sign off each stage of processes.

5:05
The first step would be creating a project.

5:38
We also have a concept of sub project.

5:40
So what a sub project is, generally when the project scope is wide and complex, it gets divided into smaller things.

5:48
So that is something known as sub project.

6:13
Then the next section is Team member you can mention.

6:16
You can define the team members whom you want this project to be assigned to.

6:26
At Max you can have 5 sub projects associated to a main project and the next section is the stakeholder.

6:59
So we have 5 departments and each department can have a one single stakeholder.

7:04
So these these are the people who are responsible to approve approval of the stages.

7:53
Is that fine?

7:58
Yeah.

7:59
What is not here?

8:01
What's Internet headlines?

8:05
These are the department name.

8:07
This is a person picker column, person picker combo walk.

8:14
OK.

8:15
And we have different stages.

8:19
OK, so we can so each, each department has this toggle button.

8:36
Once this is turned on, only then these people can approve this particular stage.

8:40
If it's turned off, you won't see the approve button.

8:43
The PRP summary screen, which I'll show you later, This is kind of a trip table.

8:49
Any question in the screen?

8:56
Not yet.

8:58
Yeah.

8:58
Go ahead.

8:58
Shruti Harish.

9:00
Yeah.

9:00
If the toggle is on, then the then the column of people selection will enable.

9:07
Does that make sense?

9:09
Can you speak a bit loud?

9:12
Yeah.

9:13
Dipen, can you hear me now?

9:16
Yeah, I can hear you.

9:17
Yeah, Yeah.

9:18
If the toggle is getting on, then the people pick a column will be enabled or work before that.

9:24
What's the relation?

9:26
We don't have any relation.

9:27
This is for the approval process.

9:30
We can assign the user at this particular stage.

9:32
I'm assigning for this particular department, engineering department, I'm assigning Michael.

9:37
So for the stage approval, this plays a vital role with toggle weapon, OK.

9:43
Yes, Apart from that, there is no association.

9:44
Yeah, thanks.

9:50
Yeah.

9:50
Any other questions?

10:12
Yeah.

10:12
So once you save the project that is going to navigate you to stage 0.

10:18
So this is the first initial stage of this application.

10:22
So this is the only stage, you know, wherein it does not require a sign off.

10:27
Remaining all stages requires a sign off.

10:29
So what is stage zero is it is the initial risk and license stage which does not require a sign off generally used to show.

10:39
Yeah, so so it is, yeah.

10:41
So it is the initial risk and license phase which does not require a sign off, generally used to show what risk may be related to a project even before the preparation phase.

10:52
So you can foresee some risk to an project.

10:54
You can, you'll note it down at this particular stage, there is something called the resource planning.

11:00
So the functionality is generally used to dedicate people or experts from a specific department to mitigate the risk related to the project.

11:10
So that's the reason why we are using this particular stage.

11:15
Coming back to planning screen.

11:39
Hello.

11:41
Yeah, Deepin, sorry for interview.

11:43
Can you zoom in this?

11:45
It is showing.

11:45
It is showing small, small words only.

11:48
Can you unlink that?

11:49
More than that?

11:50
OK.

11:51
And let's do one thing.

11:52
Let's do that.

12:05
Is it clear now?

12:08
Yes, yes, Zippin.

12:51
You there people, They're not able to hear you.

14:29
Karthik Karlina.

14:36
Next of the Teraja application is KT Schedule.

14:50
Karlina, please.

14:55
Yeah, yeah, I'm back.

15:38
Sorry.

15:45
Can you hear me?

16:33
Yeah, so state zero as I explain it, the initial risk analysis stage which does not require a sign off.

16:40
So all the issues that we will be recorded over here and we can assign a expert over here any question with this particular state.

17:59
So we have the sent for approval button.

18:02
One click of this, an e-mail would be triggered to the export.

18:13
So what will happen is they'll receive the e-mail along with the application link they have to click over here and they'll go through all the threats.

18:21
Based on that, they're going to guide the user for the future steps.

18:27
So now we'll move to the next stage until unless you don't fix engage next step, you cannot access the stage 1.

18:38
So the first step should be this engage next step.

18:41
Without that, you won't be able to access any of the other stages.

18:44
So it's a process stage zero, stage one, Stage two, you also have something called a bot project.

18:50
So there are two ways that the bot project works.

18:52
One is from the state zero.

18:54
Once you abort this project, this is going to delete it from this app itself.

18:58
And when you have completed state zero and you click on abort, it is going to move to the archive table.

19:06
Is it clear?

19:08
You have one query the PDF icon which is there that is to generate the PDF and also send them an e-mail.

19:15
Yeah, it is just generating.

19:17
No, no, no, no.

19:21
So suppose, suppose I am the expert, I'll log into the app and I'll see all this other risks, you know, that is associated with this project.

19:30
I can click on this PDF option and this is going to trigger an e-mail with all the details that have been like, sorry.

19:42
All right.

19:45
OK, got it.

19:55
So from stage 1 to stage 4, it is almost identical.

19:59
The difference is the color coding related with the answer team is giving which changes as the project progress.

20:06
So we have this topic and subtopics.

20:08
So all these topics and subtopic is is associated with the project.

20:12
This is completely comfortable.

20:14
From the SharePoint list, based on the value you select, you'll get a color code.

20:37
The first two fields are the first two section at mandatory and for all the other section until and unless you don't toggle it on it won't be applicable.

21:48
So once you have turned it on, you have to fill the values.

23:14
The data is safe.

23:22
So this is the project.

23:23
You can see that we are on stage 1.

23:31
So from stage 1 to stage 4 the process is same.

23:37
So we have topic and subtopic, same thing you have to do, you have to fill the value.

23:42
So each subtopic is nothing but a group of questions related to a specific risk type.

23:46
For example, working at hight, electrical safety, all those things.

23:50
So all this process is same except for pre installation.

23:59
So this is an additional state which has its own subtopic which shows rest more specific to on site installation work.

24:07
So this is different from the other stages.

24:09
So this is an additional state.

24:11
We have a separate sign off for this particular state.

24:15
Go back.

24:18
So once we have completed till page 4, which is almost same how we have seen for page one, we'll go to the PRP summary screen.

24:28
So PRP summary screen.

24:31
So this is nothing, but it's kind of a seat map that shows the overall risk status of the project.

24:37
So you have seen for the stage one we have filled this four section, this three section that's the reason why the color has changed.

24:44
And if the user want to see what not the user, if the stakeholder want to see what has been filled under this particular section, he has to click on the color code.

24:53
So here he'll see all the details that has been filled.

24:56
So for this particular value, it was filled as no solution.

24:59
So all these details will be shown over here.

25:02
Any question and the final thing would be the sign off.

25:30
You can also generate a PDF for this particular system.

25:33
Once you click on the PDF, we are also going to generate a PDF.

25:39
And the final thing is the approval process.

25:43
So this is completely based.

25:45
OK, let's let's start the yeah, so this this approval is completely based on the stakeholder table which we have defined when we were creating the project.

26:05
So if we edit the project, so based on this toggle values, we'll see the data in that PRP summary screen.

26:16
Suppose if we are turning any of the stages off, that particular approval should be disabled in that particular PRP summary screen.

26:23
So this is kind of a true table for that, for that approval process.

26:38
So based on the data that has been filled over here, you'll see this approval button.

26:44
So once, once the approval process has completed for stage 1, then only we can start with the stage two process.

27:29
Yeah.

27:29
Any questions?

27:34
What was it pending for the pending button?

27:40
Which pending button?

27:42
There was another button, right?

27:44
Besides approval.

27:46
Besides approval.

27:47
So yeah, before approval, it was in pending state.

27:51
Oh, so that stage it was showing.

27:54
Yeah.

27:55
And is there any way to reject this or recall it more?

28:05
So the only option is to approve, otherwise like we don't have any other options for this Stage 1.

28:13
Yeah, that's the only way.

28:15
You can go and hide it from the table, but this needs to be approved.

28:20
We're not rejecting anything because the project has already started.

28:23
That's what I have said.

28:24
And page 0, the only rejection that can happen is at this particular stage.

28:38
That is the bot project.

28:39
We got it.

28:42
OK, So in between any of the stages we do, we don't have any options to reject or like we are.

28:51
No, we are not rejecting anything because the project is in progress.

28:55
There's nothing called as we are mitigating the risk over here.

28:57
Got it.

28:59
Understood.

29:00
If the risk is too much, then they won't start the project itself, they'll abort it.

29:04
The other option is if they're aborting it from some other stage, it is going to archive it.

29:20
Understood.

29:20
So if I said the installation has a separate sign of process, it's same as that of the other screen, other stages that approval this is going to come and approve it.

29:29
That's any other questions we can bring the project back from a archival also is it possible?

29:44
No, Once it is archived, it is, it is Facebook as of now, no, we are not proceeding with any other steps on this once it has been archived.

29:57
But going forward if we have a requirement like then when we have to update the code so there would be a new app.

30:06
Understood.

30:07
OK.

30:19
Yeah.

30:19
Any other questions?

30:24
OK.

30:27
Is there any way to bring back the aborted project or it's OK, it'll be deleted permanently?

30:36
Yeah.

30:36
So from stage zero, if you're aborting, it is gonna delete it.

30:41
If you are aborting the project from stage one, it is gonna archive.

30:46
OK, So here aborting and archiving is 2 separate things.

30:58
When it is aborted, it is getting complete deletion, right?

31:02
No, that depends on the.

31:05
So suppose suppose I'm at stage 0 and I'm aborting the project.

31:11
It's going to delete it.

31:13
I'm going to delete it.

31:16
There's no concept of archive.

31:21
But if I'm going to stage 1 and aborting it, this is going to archive it.

31:33
Our delete is happening only at stage zero.

31:35
Stage 1 onwards, it's going to archive the data, OK.

31:42
And regarding the retrieval, as of now we have not implemented that, but going forward they may require it because skeleton app is in place.

31:54
OK, so we can't retrieve it, but do we have a way to view that archived part apart from directly viewing it in the SharePoint?

32:02
Yeah.

32:06
So there's something called as access to all archives public.

32:11
So here you can see all the archives.

32:13
Perfect.

32:17
OK, understood.

32:36
Yeah.

32:36
Any other queries?

32:38
There's something also called as conditions.

32:43
OK, there is also concept called as condition in pop up.

32:47
So you can see here we have a button to create a condition.

32:51
So what is the condition when stakeholders provide condition.

32:55
So usually it's the stakeholders who are going to provide provide the condition.

33:00
This means that the stakeholders grant approval for the state sign off, but has some condition that needs to be taken by the project team member before they can move to the next stage.

33:12
That is the condition.

33:16
So usually once stakeholders come to this particular page, he's going to view all the data that has been filled by the user.

33:23
Based on that, he's going to add some conditions I'm adding for the main project update for another topic, this department engineering.

34:09
So you can see all the conditions over here.

34:11
So the user will go through this condition and he'll mark it as completed if he has completed it.

34:17
And if he has some attachment, you can also add an attachment over here.

34:27
So this is the last thing of this app.

34:30
Any questions depends.

34:40
This overall process which you explained, is there any document, you know, they ask for the step by step process?

34:46
Is it documented anywhere?

34:48
No, I haven't.

34:49
No, I haven't.

34:50
Uh huh.

34:51
OK Yakov has a documented documentation.

34:55
Client has a documentation.

34:59
You have client, client, client.

35:02
OK.

35:11
OK.

35:12
Will it be possible to walk through some part of the code?

35:17
Yeah.

35:18
Which part of the code?

35:19
One, code 1, do we have any flow for this?

35:26
Yeah, there are a couple of flows for this.

35:28
The stakeholders sign off and one is for the resource allocation, dev stage, prod or everything is In Sync.

36:34
Yes, yes, yeah.

36:48
And the data source used is share, is it SharePoint?

36:52
Yeah, SharePoint, that SharePoint we just have, we just have laws, laws that's pretty straightforward.

37:02
We're just notifying and there's nothing, you know, complex over there.

37:33
So what part of code you want me to exchange with you?

37:39
If possible, then overall part of the code, but if not possible, any important part where, you know, we can just get to from stage 1 to stage 4.

37:48
It's pretty straightforward.

37:49
Straightforward.

37:52
Yeah.

37:52
Just I'm using a patch function to prove that you tend to the that point and the complex part is in the logical part.

38:02
Especially the PRPS are very clean.

38:08
The UI design takes a lot of time rather than the logical part over here.

38:16
OK, the reason being Harish and Aman are a bit new right?

38:21
If a walkthrough is there, the KT will be helpful for that, like the core walkthrough.

38:37
Yeah.

38:37
So this gallery which I'm working on currently.

38:42
OK, let's start.

39:36
OK, I'm connected via phone.

39:38
The code is not loading at all.

39:48
Yeah, so the flow is pretty close now, defining an e-mail template, updating the project code, replacing those values of project ID and all, and they're sending the e-mail to the respective stakeholders.

40:02
So using deep linking, the user is going to log into the application and continue the process.

42:49
Yeah, maybe I would recommend, you know, you can go through the code and you can let me know if you have some queries.

42:53
It's not loading at my end.

43:01
Yeah.

43:01
So it's pretty straightforward over here.

43:04
And there are certain validation that we checking over here.

43:07
So I have already marked it with a fixed sign so that that validation would be done in the beginning and directly I'm passing it.

43:15
For this gallery I'm using a for all loop, looping through all the values, patching it.

43:22
Same thing for the team members, looping through all the galleries, patching once that is done.

43:56
So in order to retrieve the data, when you click on this particular button, I'm searching the data from the SharePoint list, putting into a collection and passing that value to the gallery present in Page one.

44:15
So this is the collection that gets loaded in the in the landing page.

44:20
So this value would be coming from the SharePoint list.

44:22
So once you have saved this once in the landing page, I'm going to collect it and put it into this collection.

44:29
And I'm going to state in this particular screen, the process remains same for all the stages.

44:37
Any question?

44:42
Yeah.

44:42
Can you please tell us it when that flow will get triggered like after which process after changing by which stage?

44:58
But here initially, you will see start an approval button, right?

45:24
So once you have approved it, you'll get a button over here, start an approval and to click on that, that's the time when the e-mail would be triggered.

45:35
So the e-mail will go to you or it'll go for the no, no, that's what I'll see.

45:43
So this is a truth table for that.

45:46
So what user has been assigned over here, right.

45:49
Based on that the e-mail would be triggered.

45:51
So we are.

45:52
So what does that mean as once you have completed the stage one, you are telling the stakeholder, see I have completed the stage 1 process, please validate it.

46:02
So all the stakeholders during the project creation, you are defining the stakeholders over here.

46:09
Yeah, yeah.

46:11
So they are going to get the e-mail notification along with the link.

46:22
So the challenges is this is a combo box and we have placed it in the gallery.

46:27
So I think everyone is aware that you know gallery default selected item doesn't work even though if you get a count it is going to state as a blank value only.

46:35
That's a challenging thing.

46:36
So currently I'm working on that one.

46:38
That is done maybe by Wednesday.

46:39
If you want we can connect back again if you have some queries.

46:44
So all the logic needs to be updated where in all I'm using combo box all those logic needs to be updated.

46:54
And you have you have also seen in the PRP summary screen whether it's a project or any other project when you are approving then you when you click multiple times on the approve button because it's path is going to take time.

47:15
So what I have done is when you are approving something that is going to take the values that is going to update the SharePoint list and after that it is going to reflect over here.

47:23
So if you make a multiple clicks, you'll get that error, network error or something.

47:29
So that also needs to be worked.

47:31
We have to put the data in a collection and once everything has been done by the user then only we should go apart.

47:37
So that logic also needs to be updated.

47:41
So these are the bugs that has been raised by user, I guess for SRM.

47:54
OK, so here depend most of the bugs reported that you have taken care, right?

48:03
Everything you have taken care of.

48:05
Yeah, it's not a bug.

48:06
OK, So the user what they're doing as you have seen right, there are multiple toggles from that particular gallery gallery.

48:15
The user will edit the project and he's directly clicking 4-5 toggle button in one go.

48:21
So what code I have written, on every toggle click we are patching the data to the SharePoint list until analyst.

48:30
So I don't know whether you people are aware of multi threading concept.

48:33
We don't have that concept in power up.

48:36
So until and unless one task is not completed.

48:39
So suppose I'm turning on the toggle for one particular department and that batch is not completed and I'm pressing some other toggle in the same row.

48:48
That will give you an error.

48:50
And once that this error comes there is no way to resolve it that it will not work.

48:54
You have to close the app and open that.

48:58
So that is something which we have to work on.

49:02
Once that happens, it will not work.

49:03
It will not work.

49:05
So now that has been fixed or how is it?

49:09
No, I've just realized that that's happened especially when your network is low.

49:15
And if I try to change the stakeholder, even changing the combo bug doesn't work.

49:23
If I do it bit fast, I change from myself to someone else for three drop downs or three combo box not drop down and I click on save, it will not work if my if I'm on low network.

49:35
So there are multiple limitations for us.

49:37
We have to work on that.

49:38
Yeah.

49:39
So I'm working on that.

49:51
OK.

49:59
Any other quick thing?

50:00
Quick thing, Hari Sharman, you guys have anything?

50:03
I would say please go through the app so we can reach out to the pin for anything.

50:24
Dipen, would it be possible if you could share the app access to the workflow account now or after your?

50:31
I think all the account has access to the next particular situation.

50:37
You mean the page environment?

50:38
OK, I'll just have a check.

50:45
I would recommend not to work on this for the next 4 days until unless I just sort this thing out.

50:52
Yeah, until the deployment is done.

50:55
You can check, check the functionality, you can create new project and you can have a look.

51:04
OK, OK.

51:13
Yeah.

51:13
Any other questions?

51:18
What was the resource allocation?

51:22
Same, same process, another resource allocation and the other one is notify stakeholder.

51:40
That's the only two that's required for this app.

51:46
So for resource and location also, it will be triggered when we approve.

51:52
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:55
So if you go to stage zero, you understood the concept of what is resource and location, right?

52:07
If you can, sorry.

52:11
If you can talk about it one more time, sorry.

52:20
So state zero again.

52:21
It's the initial, yeah, it's a initial risk analysis state which does not require a sign off.

52:30
So this is the only stage which does not require a sign off.

52:33
So here you're going to foresee the risk associated with the project and you're going to note that in this particular section.

52:39
Once that is noted, the stakeholder is going to assign you a export.

52:45
So he's going to help you out in in order to mitigate the risk that you foresee in the project.

52:51
That's the concept of resource allocation.

52:55
So you can locate the resource over here.

52:58
And once the resource is allocated, he's going to meet you in person and you will have a discussion was that he's going to guide you through the next step, next stages rather than steps.

53:13
A person will come to assist us, yes, and this is going to happen in the back, back end.

53:21
Expecting something to happen in that.

53:23
That's the that's the last thing that they're going to do.

53:25
The social location.

53:26
Then they're going to meet up.

53:27
They're going to have an internal meeting.

53:29
They're going to have the discussion.

53:31
And based on that, he's going to guide you in the next step.

53:34
Next stage is stage 1 to stage 4 topics and subtopics is nothing but it's a group of patient related to specific site which is seen page one.

53:56
So this is a topic and inside this this is a topic.

54:06
For example working at height they are doing some electrical stuff, electrical PC.

54:11
All these things covers under the pages topics and sub topics.

54:23
Yeah.

54:24
Any other questions?

54:34
So the risk management is happening on this color code.

54:37
Based on this color code, the stakeholder is gonna define the severity of the risk based on that he's gonna give you.

54:47
Yeah, those are disabled right now.

54:51
Yeah, because there's in that mode, I have directly landed to the screen.

54:56
OK, initially the first two topics is mandatory and other thing based on the progress, you can decide whether you want to fill those values or you don't want to fill those values.

55:16
So there's some mandatory, you can see the* over here.

55:19
And starting from the three until unless you don't toggle it on, you won't be able to fill the value.

55:26
So when you toggle it on, you can fill the value.

55:30
So if you toggle it on, it will become mandatory, right?

55:35
No, it's not mandatory.

55:36
You can fill some of the values.

55:37
You can.

55:38
It depends on you what kind of discussion you had with the resource team.

55:43
So he's going to tell you, yeah, OK, this is the thing which I find, you know, can cause an issue.

55:47
You can provide these two values over here.

55:50
Based on that, stakeholder is going to judge OK, whether we can proceed to the next stage or do we require some more work.

55:57
If we require some more work, the stakeholder is going to add some condition.

56:02
Once we add some condition, we have to.

56:12
So we have to go through that condition.

56:14
Once we have fulfilled, you will get a completed toggle over here.

56:17
You have to mark it as complete.

56:19
Then the stakeholders is again going to review the data and based on that we can move to the next stage.

56:29
OK.

56:57
Yeah, We have something called is completed over here.

57:00
Once we have finished this, you can mount this as complete.

57:11
Any other questions what is that is completed about to the completed filter?

57:26
All these are filters.

57:30
OK is completed.

57:33
So there is a possibility you know wherein they may require a KPISI have already worked on it, go on.

57:58
In case if they want the KPI, the screen is already ready.

58:01
You just have to make this as the landing screen in case going forward, if you get a ticket or something, everything is in place.

58:11
They were telling something about the KPI.

58:15
Would be good if they can see the KPI, but as of now they have not asked us to.

58:21
But the solution is in place.

58:23
We just have to change the landing screen.

58:25
That's it.

58:27
Just an FI, any other question, If you want, I can share the scope document.

58:44
I think I have already shared it with ****** and Sanjana.

58:47
You can go through that also.

58:50
Yeah, they can.

58:50
I'll share it with them.

59:16
Anything else?

59:21
Nothing from my side.

59:24
Can we conclude something from my end?

59:30
How do you show me?

59:31
Yeah, it's clear now, Kartik.

59:42
Yeah.

59:42
The.

59:42
No, Nothing from my end.

59:45
OK.

59:46
Thank you.
